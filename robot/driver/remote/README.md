# Controlling the Spider

## Using the DualShock 4 Wireless Controller

We use ds4drv to connect to the controller via bluetooth. Run `ds4drv --hidraw --dameon` to start searching for the controller. Hold down the middle PlayStation button and the Share button at the same time to pair the controller. The controller is connected when the LED on the back stays lit up.
